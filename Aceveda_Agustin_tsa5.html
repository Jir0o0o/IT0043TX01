    <p class="desc">Ryomen Sukuna (両りょう面めん宿すく儺な Ryōmen Sukuna?), more often referred to as simply Sukuna (宿すく儺な Sukuna?), is the strongest jujutsu sorcerer from over a thousand years ago. Regarded as the undisputed King of Curses (呪のろいの王おう Noroi no Ō?), Sukuna is one of the primary antagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series.
    

        According to legend, Sukuna was an Imaginary Demon (仮か想そうの鬼き神じん Kasō no Kijin?) during the Heian Era. In truth, he was a human sorcerer also known as the Disgraced One (堕だ天てん Daten?). Jujutsu sorcerers of the Golden Age of Jujutsu gave their all against him but ultimately fell one after another. Sukuna existed throughout the ages by transforming into a cursed object after death, a state where he split his power into twenty indestructible fingers.
        
        Sukuna was incarnated in June 2018 when Yuji Itadori consumed one of his fingers. Sukuna was trapped inside Yuji's body and was rarely in control until he managed to transfer his soul into the body of Megumi Fushiguro.</p>
